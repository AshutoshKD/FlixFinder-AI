Based on its visual style (dark, moody color palette, focus on character expression, anime style) and the thematic elements suggested (young protagonist, possibly pensive or brooding mood), here are 10 recommendations for movies or TV shows with similar visual or thematic elements:\n\n\n**Anime/Animation:**\n\n1. **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood:** Shares the dark fantasy setting, strong character development, and intense emotional moments.  Similar color palettes are often used.\n2. **Attack on Titan:** Features a similar brooding atmosphere, intense action sequences, and complex characters facing overwhelming odds.  Dark and gritty aesthetics are prominent.\n3. **My Hero Academia:** Though brighter in tone overall, it features a strong focus on character development of a young protagonist with a unique skillset, similar to Killua’s journey.\n4. **Mob Psycho 100:** Shares a similar art style in some scenes and features a young, powerful protagonist grappling with internal struggles and a complex world.\n\n\n**Live-Action (with Anime-esque or Thematically Similar elements):**\n\n5. **The Lord of the Rings:** Epic fantasy with a young protagonist (Frodo) on a perilous journey, often featuring moments of quiet contemplation against expansive backdrops.\n6. **Game of Thrones (Seasons 1-4):**  Shares the dark fantasy elements,  complex characters navigating a morally gray world, and a focus on power struggles. \n7. **His Dark Materials:** A young protagonist, Lyra, discovers a dark, complex world with hidden powers and adult themes.\n\n\n**Animated Movies (Thematically Similar):**\n\n8. **Spirited Away:**  Features a young protagonist going on a magical journey of self-discovery, although the visuals are brighter and more fantastical.\n9. **Howl's Moving Castle:**  Shares a similar fantasy aesthetic and features a strong female protagonist facing adversity.\n\n\n**Manga (If broadening scope beyond movies/TV):**\n\n10. **Vinland Saga:** Shares the violent yet philosophical themes with a dark, mature tone.\n\n\nThese recommendations consider both visual similarities (color palettes, animation styles) and thematic resonance (young protagonist on a journey, dark fantasy elements, emotional depth).  The level of thematic overlap varies, but all offer some connection to the mood and style presented in the provided image.\n"
